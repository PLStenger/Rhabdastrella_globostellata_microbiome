# Note: Interpreting alpha diversity metrics: it is important to understand that certain metrics are stricly qualitative (presence/absence), 
# that is they only take diversity into account, often referred to as richness of the community (e.g. observed otus). 
# In contrast, other methods are quantitative in that they consider both richness and abundance across samples, commonly referred to as evenness (e.g. Shannon). 
# Yet other methods take phylogenetic distance into account by asking how diverse the phylogenetic tree is for each sample. 
# These phylogenetic tree-based methods include the popular Faithâ€™s PD, which calculates the sum of the branch length covered by a sample
